**AI Multi-Agent Trip Planner**
“This is a small project I built to try multi-agent AI for travel planning…”

*Problem Statement*:
Whenever we try to plan a trip, we usually end up switching between multiple apps and websites — for finding places, checking weather, estimating expenses, converting currencies, and creating an itinerary. This process is scattered, repetitive, and takes extra effort. There isn’t a single tool that can handle everything in one place while also adjusting to user needs.

*How it Works*

--> I built a small application that uses the multi-agent concept. Instead of one big program doing everything, I divided the work into smaller agents:

--> A place search agent (finds tourist spots, restaurants, etc.)

--> A weather agent (gives weather info for the destination)

--> An expense agent (keeps track of costs and budget)

--> A currency conversion agent (helps with foreign trips)

These agents communicate with each other and combine their results to create a simple trip plan. The goal was not to make it overly complex but to show how splitting tasks between agents can make planning more organized and efficient.

*Tech Stack*:
Python, LangChain, Streamlit, APIs (weather, mock flights/hotels).
